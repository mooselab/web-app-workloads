# aiops_benchmarking_framework
This repository contains the code and datasets for the project “AIOps Benchmarking Framework”.

## Introduction
The repository is organized into three file folders.
1.	Codes: this folder contains code for the experiments. The folder is divided into two subfolders of  “extracting datasets” and “clustering”. The first folder is used to extract the datasets (which will appear in the [Extracted Datasets Folder](./extracted_datasets/). The second folder is used to perform clustering on the datasets. The results of the clustering is available in the [Results Folder](./results/).
2.	Extracted datasets: this folder contains the 10 datasets we study.
3.	Results: this folder contains the results to answer the research questions.
